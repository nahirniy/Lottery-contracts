## IERC7401

Interface smart contract of the RMRK nestable module.

### DirectOwner

The core struct of RMRK ownership.

_The `DirectOwner` struct is used to store information of the next immediate owner, be it the parent token or
 the externally owned account.
If the token is owned by the externally owned account, the `tokenId` should equal `0`._
