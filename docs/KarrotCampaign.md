### setTicketContract

### burnTicket

```solidity
function burnTicket() external
```

Burns the user's ticket for the current campaign.

Transfers the burning ticket to the owner of the last ticket ID.
Transfers the last ticket ID to the burning campaign.
The owner of the last ticket loses it, but received the burning ticket.
We swap the ticket to be burned with the last ticket, then burn the last one.
Due this swap approach user's ticket ID(s) may change and it's expected behaviour,
since it does not change the chance of winning lottery_
